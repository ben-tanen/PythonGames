## Games in Python
#### Blackjack, Battleship, Minesweeper

These are all projects that I did as I was learning Python along the way.

**Battleship** is an extended version of the Codacademy project with some extra features.

**Minesweeper** is an original project that uses similar mechanics to Battleship. One of my first novel projects in Python.

**Blackjack** was once I finally had learned what classes were. This was my first project using classes in Python (I had only previously done them in C/C++). I think it's better written than the other two, but not *great*.

If I have the chance, I'll maybe re-try / refactor these games to see if I can make it any better...
